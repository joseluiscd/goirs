# GoIRS
Information Retrieval System written in Go

# About this project
This project was written for a course of Information Retrieval Systems at University. After a few months,
I decided to release it as an open source project.

# About the software
GoIRS is a library, but it has some test programs (goirs-* directories). They were only intended to work
with the Corpus we were provided, but the library should work with any text file (except some parts that
work only with spanish-written texts, as are the stopper and the stemmer). All of this may be solved
eventually.

Special thanks to the [snowball stemmer library](https://github.com/kljensen/snowball).
